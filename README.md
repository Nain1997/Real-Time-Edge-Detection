The objective of the program given is to perform edge detection of images in real-time.The popular canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect a wide range of edges in images. OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() which takes our input image as first argument and its aperture size(min value and max value) as last two arguments.

Requirement --> Python 2.7.x version, numpy and OpenCV 2.7.x or 3.1.0 version.
